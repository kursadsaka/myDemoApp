This a homework project to become familiar with the code repository with continuous integration and deployment.<br />
We have a function taking four parameters and doing computation on them.<br />
Description of the function on the demo site:<br />

In the first form, enter a list of integers seperated by a newline character.<br />
In the second form, enter another integer.<br />
The first operation will be true if square of the integer found in the first list.<br />
In the third form, enter a list of integers seperated by a newline character.<br />
In the fourth form, enter another integer.<br />
The second operation will be true if the sum of the integers in the second list multiplied by the first integer equals to the second integer.<br />
The result becomes true if both operations is true.<br />
