This a homework project to become familiar with the code repository with continuous integration and deployment.
We have a function taking four parameters and doing computation on them.
Description of the function on the demo site:

In the first form, enter a list of integers seperated by a newline character.
In the second form, enter another integer.
The first operation will be true if square of the integer found in the first list.
In the third form, enter a list of integers seperated by a newline character.
In the fourth form, enter another integer.
The second operation will be true if the sum of the integers in the second list multiplied by the first integer equals to the second integer.
The result becomes true if both operations is true.
